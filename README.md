## Mod Merging

TCML integrates with multiple mod merging tools to support the seamless combination of various file types.

### Current Supported File Types

* **ResourceSizeTable** support leverages [dt-12345](https://github.com/dt-12345)'s restbl tool for an efficient Resource Size Table (RSTB) estimation, and creation.
* **RSDB** *(Tag.Product, PouchActorInfo, GameActorInfo, etc.)* makes use of [Legend5v](https://gamebanana.com/members/2731522)'s original code with added QoL features for efficient and funtional merging.
* **Localization (Mals)** created by [Arch Leaders](https://github.com/ArchLeaders), his [MalsMerger](https://github.com/ArchLeaders/MalsMerger) is lightning fast, ensuring you recieve your merged files as fast as possible.
    
### Planned Support:
    
* **SARC:** Archives
* **BYML:** Parameter Files
* **BFRES:** Models
* **TXTG:** Textures

> Note: Priority-based merging for specific file types (e.g., SARC archives, bgyml, byml, bfres, txtg).

## Usage

### For Creators:

If you are a mod creator, and would like your mod to be fully supported by TCML, here are the steps you can follow:

> *(TCML will work without this, just some easy stuff to help visually assist end users)*

- Add a `meta.json` file with a structure like this:
  ```jsonc
  {
    "modName": "Your Mod Name",
    "description": "Description of your mod",
    "author": "Your Name",
    // Add any other relevant information
  }
  ```

- Add a thumbnail.png file with the thumbnail for your mod!

**TCML will now seamlessly merge your mod!**
